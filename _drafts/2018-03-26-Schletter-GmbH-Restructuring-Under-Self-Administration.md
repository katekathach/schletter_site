<p>At Schletter, we want to keep our customers and partners well informed. You may have seen in the news earlier this week that Schletter GmbH in Kirchdorf, Germany announced restructuring under self-administration.  This is very similar to Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. law. </p>
<p>The Schletter Group, with production facilities in Germany, the United States, and China are a global network of distribution and service companies. Schletter Inc., located in Shelby, North Carolina, and Schletter Canada Inc., located in Windsor, Ontario are the North American branches of the larger Schletter Group. Schletter Inc. and Schletter Canada Inc. <strong>were not included</strong> in the Schletter GmbH restructuring plan, and operate as legally and financially independent organizations, unaffected by the restructuring process.</p>

<h4><strong>What does this mean for Schletter's customers and partners?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Both Schletter Inc. and Schletter Canada Inc. will continue design, manufacture, and support customers for all their solar racking projects.</li>
<li>Schletter Inc.  works closely with Schletter GmbH, and other subsidiaries collaborating on product engineering, sales and marketing, etc. to offer a premier solar racking solution to customers worldwide. The self-administration process in Germany will have no effect on this collaboration, which shall continue both during and after it is concluded.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does this mean for the Schletter headquarters in Germany?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>At its core, Schletter GmbH is a healthy company.</li>
<li>The self-administration proceedings offer a legal framework to solve the financial issues and bring the restructuring to a successful conclusion either by reaching a settlement with the creditors or by involving investors. </li>
<li>Business operations continue at full capacity for Schletter GmbH in Germany.  The headquarters will continue to manufacture and deliver quality products in a timely manner.</li>
<li>The restructuring process is expected to be complete in the summer.</li>
</ul>
