author: Schletter Inc.
excerpt: As the premier manufacturer of high-grade steel solar mounting systems, Schletter offers the next generation of racking with G-Max. G-Max’s fixed-tilt construction is ideally suited for utility-scale installations, and exceptional ease-of-assembly in the field and competitive pricing distinguish this American-made steel mounting system from their competitors. In fact, widely recognized for its thoughtful, streamlined design and components that are known for their strength and safety, the G-Max system’s fast and easy installation is so simple that a single person can install the girder, head adapter, and strut without assistance.
