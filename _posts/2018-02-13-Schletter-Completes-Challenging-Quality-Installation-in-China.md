<p>The Schletter Group has completed another ambitious project in China.  The 35 MW Anhui Jin solar farm in Anhui Province was individually designed for hilly terrain with slopes up to 30 degrees. The mounting system used for the solar panels was Schletter Group’s FS Uno.</p><p>“We are already in an excellent position in the fast-growing Chinese market,” Florian Roos, said. He is managing director of the Schletter facility in Shanghai, where the mounting systems for the project was manufactured.  “This project, which is particularly demanding due to its topography, contributes to further strengthening our reputation as a leader in terms of quality.”  The Schletter Group employs over 450 people in Shanghai and, with a total of around 2.5 GW of installed PV capacity, is one of the largest foreign suppliers of PV mounting systems in Asia.</p></div>
