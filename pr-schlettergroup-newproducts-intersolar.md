<!--<h3>Company History</h3>-->
<p>Kirchdorf/Haag, 4 April 2017. The globally operating <a href="http://www.schletter-group.com">Schletter Group</a> is launching a host of new and advanced products at this year's <a href="http://www.intersolar.de/en/home.html">Intersolar Europe</a>, Booth A4.180. The focus here is on the greatly simplified handling of the products – for users and traders alike. Highlights include, for example, the complete redesign of the Rapid 16 module clamp family in addition to pre-assembled module kits, which greatly facilitate the planning and installation of PV systems.</p>
<p>The Rapid 16 module clamp on show at Intersolar sees the Schletter Group introducing a module clamp family that has been completely re-designed from scratch. With just a handful of product variants, this intelligently designed clamp covers the entire range of applications. Thanks to rotatable clamps and flexible clamping widths, it is suitable for mounting all standard module sizes – with both vertical and horizontal clamping. This greatly facilitates planning and installation for users. For traders, this reduces the expenditure for warehousing dramatically: instead of keeping as to date over 190 product variants in stock, five suffice in future. </p>
<p>This is achieved thanks to the clamp's intelligent design. Unlike its predecessor, which was available in numerous fixed clamping widths in one-millimetre increments, the clamping range of the Rapid 16 is flexible, with the low module clamps being capable of holding modules with a frame height of 30 to 40 mm, and the higher ones being designed for frame heights of 40 to 50 mm. As such, the clamps fit all standard systems. Due to the side leg of the clamp gripping into a locking system during mounting, the module frame is still fastened as before to the precise millimetre within this range.

</p>
<p>The Rapid 16 module clamp fits all Schletter module bearing rails with an 8 mm click channel and is designed for module frame heights of 30 to 50 mm. All the clamps feature an integral grounding pin. They are available in either a natural aluminium or black anodised finish so that they can be matched up visually also to black module frames.
</p>
<h3>Quick and easy - modular mounting kits</h3>
<p>To facilitate and reduce the cost of planning and installing small PV systems, the Schletter Group is introducing pre-assembled mounting kits. These entail pre-assembled installation modules, which can be combined on the basis of a modular system. This simplifies planning and speeds up the installation process on site avoiding any need for cutting to size. In addition, customers benefit from shorter delivery times thanks to optimised warehousing and a lower system price thanks to standardisation. </p>
<p>For flat roof systems, the Schletter Group provides its AluGrid and AluGrid100 systems in kit form. These systems are ideally suited for solar modules mounted on flat roofs in east-west orientation. The aerodynamic optimisation means that only low superimposed loads are required, which are individually structurally verified. Using the AluGrid100 kits, it is possible to install either one to three double module rows with pre-assembled module bearings and cut-to-size pieces of the surface protection mat that are already attached</p>
<p>The inexpensive and proven ground mount system PvMax will also be presented as a kit solution at Intersolar. The kits are supplied along with all the components for the bearing structure so that the construction of the plant can commence immediately. The smaller PvMax Energy-Kit can be used for the installation of 22 modules (2 rows with 11 modules), the larger PvMax Energy-Kit with 44 modules (2 rows with 22 modules). Both can be extended with up to 4 modules. A type structural analysis is also offered in prefabricated variants. The kits are designed for standard 60 cell modules with dimensions of up to 1000 x 1700 mm. Module clamps can also be ordered for specific module frames. </p>
<h3>New, inexpensive installation solutions for trapezoidal sheet metal</h3>
<p>
For roofs covered with trapezoidal sheet metal, the Schletter Group is presenting two new fastening solutions. The company is for example extending its offering with its newly developed EcoRapid clamp. Using the clamp allows PV modules to be mounted directly on the trapezoidal sheet metal, without any need for module clamps or mounting rails. Consequently, this solution is particularly quick and inexpensive. The clamp is hooked directly into the frame profile of the module, which makes for an extremely secure and strong installation.
</p>
<p>The new trapezoidal roof fastener ClampFit 17 is designed for the horizontal and vertical installation of modules on trapezoidal sheet metal roofs. Whereas up until now 17 different product versions were available for various geometries and areas of application, the rule "one fits all" applies in future, i.e. a single version suffices. The new Rapid16 fastening clamp can thus be used for fastening all standard modules. What is more, this combination of ClampFit 17 and Rapid16 is less expensive than the ClampFit-H clamps used to date. </p>
<h3>Pitched roof installation solutions for extreme loading</h3>
<p>The Schletter Group has developed its FixTK fastening solution specifically for types of roof construction with bitumen shingles widely used in Scandinavia and Canada. This entails a fastening solution which, due to its simple shape and central force absorption, is capable of supporting very heavy snow loads.

The Schletter Group has further improved the strength of important components also for this part of the world. By way of example, the company is presenting its galvanised roof hook S700 which, thanks to its enhanced geometry and circumferential welds, affords 2.5 times the bearing capacity of its predecessor.
