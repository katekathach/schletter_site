<h4>FS Uno Saves Time and Money with 15% Reduction in Parts</h4>
<section class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
<p>Based on Schletter's legendary FS System, 
this 100% galvanized steel option has been re-engineered making it stronger while reducing the overall parts needed for the project.
The FS Uno is known for its product longevity and is highly prefabricated to offer a long term ground mount solution that is even faster to install with the new design. 
An estimated savings of $10-$12 per kw installed is possible. The FS Uno surpasses the competition in affordability, ease-of-installation, 
and quality by meeting or exceeding all applicable IBC and ASCE standards. Also engineered for versatility, the FS Uno offers two distinct configurations: 
traditional south facing or east-west facing for unique layout situations (FS Uno-100).
