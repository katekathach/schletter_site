                  </p>
                <div>There is no specific wind rating for solar mounting systems. Any mounting system can be designed to withstand wind loads of 240 mph and beyond. It is not a question of the mounting systems but a question of the costs and whether a building is capable of taking the loads aligned with a design for those wind loads. The modules usually do not withstand heavy wind loads.</div>

                <ul>
                  <li>No. To get accurate results and an accurate embedment depth practical tests have to be performed on each single project site. The costs for these tests are included in the pricing of larger FS or FS Uno systems.</li>
                  <li>Basing the embedment depth only on geotechnical reports is very conservative. Especially on larger systems this often means that too much material is sold as the embedment depth was judged to deep.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Yes the post is galvanized to ensure the lifetime of the PV system.</li>
                  <li>We use hot dip galvanizing. The post is galvanized after all holes have been drilled and everything is cut. This results in an advantage of a closed galvanized coating.</li>
                  <ul id="inner">
                    <li>Many use pre-bend galvanized steel for their steel parts in a solar system. This has the advantage of being a little less expensive but the disadvantage is having cut edges and drilled holes exposed to the weather which in the end means corrosion will start much faster.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Not necessarily a special machine, as many pile drivers can do the work. However a tool is needed that has the shape of our posts. Our posts have a special shape allowing for secure positioning in the soil and a reduced embedment depth. Whether the GAYK hydraulic ram is used, which Schletter supplies, or another tool, ease of maneuverability throughout the jobsite should be considered. Alternatively, the PVMax System uses concrete footings which sit atop the ground, and do not require pile driving.</li>
                  <li>Schletter has a program for renting and purchasing GAYK rams, email <a href="mailto:mail.us@schletter-group.com">mail.us@schletter-group.com</a> for a quote.</li>

                <div>Yes. Schletter engineers are capable of recalculating buildings to verify whether it can hold up to the loads of a PV system. However this is an additional charge for the customer. We use an independent third party engineer to ensure the accuracy of the calculations by an independent source. </div>

                  </p>
                <ul>
                  <div>Schletter offers several steel systems for ground mount applications including the FS Uno, Duo, and FS Track II.</div>
                  <li>In recent years, steel has proven less expensive to buy on the commodity market compared to aluminum. However, aluminum is lighter in weight and when aluminum prices drop, it can be a more cost-effective choice. Speak with a Schletter sales representative to see which option is best for your project. </li>
                  <li>It is easier to handle aluminum on the construction site which saves labor costs. Especially on large scale systems the handling of the material is a cost driver. Transportation costs are lowered using aluminum.</li>

                <div>This depends very much on actual site conditions. In general it can be said that an experienced crew of 8 people can mount 1 MW of the FS System in 10 days. (Driving the posts, setting up the rack and clamping the modules to the rack – no electrical work.) </div>
