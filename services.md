<p>Whenever a ground mount post is driven into the ground, soil testing is required to minimize the embedment depth.
Some of the largest solar systems in the world are FS Systems™ and soil testing ensures system stability and longevity.
Schletter always conducts a detailed geotechnical investigation prior to the installation of a ground mounted photovoltaic system.

<ul>
<li>Soil samples are removed from the project site</li>
